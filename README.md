\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Tiling & Block Sizes}
	We define three block-size parameters: BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, and BLOCK_K.
	\\ In typical transformer layers, you would tune these block sizes to suit the shapes of your Q, K, V, and feedforward matrices.
	\\ Different GPUs benefit from different tile configurations. For example, on an A100 you might try (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K) = (128, 128, 32) or (128, 256, 64).
	\item{Grouping}
	The kernel uses a GROUP_SIZE_M concept to group blocks along the M dimension. This helps reuse data in L2/L1 caches effectively and can boost performance for large M. Tuning GROUP_SIZE_M is a knob you can experiment with.
	\item{Accumuluator Precision}
	We accumulate partial sums in tl.float32 to improve numerical stability when multiplying FP16 operands. This is standard practice in ML frameworks: multiply in FP16, accumulate in FP32 (a.k.a. “FP16->FP32 mixed-precision”).
	\\ At the end of the loop, we cast the accumulator back to FP16. If you want BF16, you can change the to(tl.float16) calls to to(tl.bfloat16).
	\item{Memory Access and Masking}
	We explicitly compute pointer addresses with A_ptr + row*stride_am + col*stride_ak. For large or small matrices, some indices might fall out of the valid range. We use tl.load(..., mask=...) to mask out-of-bounds threads, setting them to zero.
	\\ We do the same in the store path for writing to C.
	\item{	Looping over K}
	The kernel has a for kb in range(k_blocks) loop to chunk the K dimension in tiles of size BLOCK_K. Each iteration loads sub-tiles from A and B, then performs a tl.dot to accumulate partial sums into acc.
	\item{Kernel Launch Configuration}
	We define the “grid” lambda so Triton knows how many 2D blocks to launch. Each block corresponds to a tile [BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N] in the C matrix. We also incorporate GROUP_SIZE_M for grouping.
	\\ num_stages and num_warps are critical performance tuning knobs in Triton. They control software pipelining depth and warp usage. Typical values might be num_stages=2 or 3, and num_warps in {4,8}, depending on your GPU. Profiling in Nsight Systems/Compute is recommended.
	\item{Benchmarks}
	I included a simple Python timing harness comparing the Triton kernel with a standard torch.matmul() which uses cuBLAS under-the-hood. For real workloads, you might measure throughput (GFLOPs/s), memory bandwidth utilization, and other metrics via Nsight.
	\item{Extensions}
	For a specialized self-attention kernel:
	\\ You could fuse the “Q x K^T” step with the softmax scaling or the subsequent “(QK^T) x V” step if you want to approach “FlashAttention”-style fusion.
	\\ For multi-head attention, you can incorporate the head dimension B or H in the indexing (often B * H, S, D).
	\\ You might store partial results in shared memory if you want more advanced memory re-use.
	\\ For a specialized MLP feedforward kernel:
	\\ You might handle two GEMMs in a row (xW1 + b1, activation, and outputW2 + b2) if you want partial fusion.
	\item{Next Steps}
	1.	Tune block sizes: Adjust (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K) to match your workload shapes and GPU architecture.
	\\ 2.	Check occupancy: Use triton.testing.test_kernel, Nsight Systems, or nvprof to see if your kernel saturates GPU SMs.
	\\ 3.	Experiment with data layouts: For example, switch B to a transposed layout for more coalesced loads if that’s beneficial for your hardware.
	\\ 4.	Incorporate warp-level matrix ops: If you want to experiment with Tensor Cores more directly (similar to CUTLASS or WMMA), investigate advanced usage patterns in Triton (though Triton often auto-generates tensor core instructions on supported hardware).
	\\ 5.	Benchmark on real LLM workloads: Validate performance improvements for actual transformer blocks using your custom GEMM in place of cuBLAS or cuBLASLt calls, measure end-to-end training throughput, memory usage, and numerical stability.}
