## 1. Tiling & Block Sizes

We define three block-size parameters: `BLOCK_M`, `BLOCK_N`, and `BLOCK_K`.  
In typical transformer layers, you would tune these block sizes to suit the shapes of your **Q**, **K**, **V**, and feedforward matrices.  

Different GPUs benefit from different tile configurations. For example, on an A100 you might try:
- `(BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K) = (128, 128, 32)`, or 
- `(128, 256, 64)`.

## 2. Grouping

The kernel uses a `GROUP_SIZE_M` concept to group blocks along the M dimension. This helps reuse data in L2/L1 caches effectively and can boost performance for large M. Tuning `GROUP_SIZE_M` is a knob you can experiment with.

## 3. Accumulator Precision

We accumulate partial sums in `tl.float32` to improve numerical stability when multiplying FP16 operands. This is standard practice in ML frameworks: multiply in FP16, accumulate in FP32 (a.k.a. “FP16->FP32 mixed-precision”).

At the end of the loop, we cast the accumulator back to FP16. If you want BF16, you can change the `to(tl.float16)` calls to `to(tl.bfloat16)`.

## 4. Memory Access and Masking

We explicitly compute pointer addresses with A_ptr + row * stride_am + col * stride_ak.
For large or small matrices, some indices might fall out of the valid range. We use tl.load(…, mask=…)
to mask out-of-bounds threads, setting them to zero.

We do the same in the store path for writing to C.

## 5. **Looping over K**
   - A `for kb in range(k_blocks)` loop chunks the `K` dimension into tiles of size `BLOCK_K`.
   - Each iteration loads sub-tiles from `A` and `B`, then performs a `tl.dot` to accumulate partial sums into `acc`.

---

## 6. **Kernel Launch Configuration**
   - Define the "grid" lambda for Triton to know how many 2D blocks to launch.
   - Each block corresponds to a tile `[BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N]` in the `C` matrix.
   - Incorporates `GROUP_SIZE_M` for grouping.
   - **Performance tuning knobs**:
     - `num_stages` (e.g., 2 or 3).
     - `num_warps` (e.g., 4 or 8), depending on your GPU.
   - Profiling tools like Nsight Systems/Compute are recommended.

## 7. **Benchmarks**
   - Includes a Python timing harness comparing the Triton kernel with `torch.matmul()` (uses cuBLAS under-the-hood).
   - Metrics to measure:
     - Throughput (GFLOPs/s).
     - Memory bandwidth utilization.
     - Other relevant metrics via Nsight.

## 8. **Extensions**
   - **Specialized self-attention kernel**:
     - Fuse “Q x K^T” with softmax scaling or “(QK^T) x V” for "FlashAttention"-style fusion.
     - Incorporate head dimension (`B` or `H`) in indexing for multi-head attention.
     - Use shared memory for advanced memory reuse.
   - **Specialized MLP feedforward kernel**:
     - Handle two GEMMs in a row (e.g., `xW1 + b1`, activation, and `outputW2 + b2`) for partial fusion.

## 9. **Next Steps**
   1. Tune block sizes:
      - Adjust `(BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N, BLOCK_K)` to match workload shapes and GPU architecture.
   2. Check occupancy:
      - Use `triton.testing.test_kernel`, Nsight Systems, or `nvprof` to ensure saturation of GPU SMs.
   3. Experiment with data layouts:
      - For example, use a transposed layout for `B` for more coalesced loads.
   4. Warp-level matrix ops:
      - Experiment with Tensor Cores for advanced patterns.
   5. Benchmark on real workloads:
      - Validate performance on transformer blocks using your custom GEMM, replacing cuBLAS/cuBLASLt calls.
      - Measure training throughput, memory usage, and numerical stability.
